This is a small sample of functional automated tests for the UI on the public gravie.com website.

This package requires the standard 'node_modules' folder to be in the same directory for Selenium to function.
Installing Selenium with Node.js in this directory should create that folder.

The pages folder contains the web elements for each page (POM).
The testLibrary folder contains functions for interacting with and testing each page.
The tests folder contains entry-point scripts for executing the tests.
